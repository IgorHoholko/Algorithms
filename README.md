## Labs

* ### [Graph](https://github.com/IgorHoholko/Algorithms/tree/master/Graph)
    **Task:** 
    + realise the Graph class;
    + realise the BFS algorithm (show in what component of the graph a point lies);
    + realise the algorithm of the Euler path check in the graph;
    + realise the algorithm of the bipartite check in the graph;
    + realise the Prime algorithm (build a Minimum Spanning Tree);
    + realise the Kruskal algorithm (build a Minimum Spanning Tree);
    + realise Dijukstar and Floyd algorithms
    + Fair Station problem
    + construct the graph that is the result of the Prime and Kraskal algorithms combination;
    
    + *visualise* (it's not necessary)

* ### [Quick sort/ Merge sort](https://github.com/IgorHoholko/Algorithms/tree/master/sort_research)
    When QuickSort works with an array, it can process the array completely
    or it can at some certain value of the array's length (threshold)
    send the array to MergeSort for further processing.

    **Task:** 
    + realise the QuickSort;
    + realise the MergeSort;
    + find the best threshold at which QuickSort with MergeSort works faster than QuickSort only;
        
* ### [Binary Search tree / Binary Search & Interpolation Search ](https://github.com/IgorHoholko/Algorithms/tree/master/BinaryTree_searchs)
    **Task:** 
    + realise the Binary and Interpolation searchs;
    + check at what values of the array's length one search works better than another one;
    + realise the Binary Search Tree with the left and right rotation;
    + come up with visualisation of the tree;
    
* ### [Hash Table with Open Addressing and Chains methods](https://github.com/IgorHoholko/Algorithms/tree/master/Hash_tables)
    **Task:** 
    + realise Hash Table with with Open Addressing collision resolution method;
    + realise Hash Table with with Chains collision resolution method;
